components needs to crawl a website
how to insert image into website:
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
to save image:
if we save right click on the image will show us the save the image from the website

how to save text from the image:
To copy the highlighted text, on your keyboard, press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C or right-click the highlighted text and click Copy.

To paste text, place your cursor in the appropriate location and press the keyboard shortcut key combination Ctrl+V, or right-click where you want to paste the text and click Paste.

The text is copied from the web page to a new or existing document. From there, you can change the formatting of the text (bold, italics, font color or size, etc.).
To solve this problem we just need system function to perform on website
